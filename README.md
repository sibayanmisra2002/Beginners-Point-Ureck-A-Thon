# Beginners-Point-Ureck-A-Thon

### Hello there! Greetings from Team - UMANG!

We are excited to introduce our e-Learning website project, created for the Ureck-A-thon competition. Our platform features comprehensive chapters on the C Programming language, designed to help users gain in-depth knowledge through high-quality content curated by us.

Unlike many websites that require subscriptions to access full notes and resources, our mission is to provide free knowledge for all. Therefore, we do not charge any subscription fees. To enhance the learning experience, we have integrated a free compiler, allowing users to practice coding while they learn.

We have prioritized user experience by designing an intuitive and easy-to-use interface. One of the standout features of our website is its completely ad-free environment, minimizing distractions and enhancing focus. Additionally, our website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across all devices.

The website is hosted on Hostinger, and all the code is available on my GitHub account. We hope you enjoy exploring our project. Check it out at the link provided below!
