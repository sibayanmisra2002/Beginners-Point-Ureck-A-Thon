# Beginners-Point-Ureck-A-Thon

### Hello there! Greetings from Team - UMANG!

This is our e-Learning website project that we have created for the Ureck-A-thon competition. we have included all the basic chapters of C Programming language, which will definitely help users to gain in depth knowledge, through high quality content, collected and provided by us in the website. 


Mostly in websites users have to take subscription for accessing full notes and all, but our motto is free knowledge for all hence we are never going to take any subscription fees for this website. Here, we have integrated a free compiler as well so that users can practice coding, while learning.


We have made the User Interface very easy to use. Our website’s most notable feature is that it’s completely ad-free, making it less annoying and distractive.
We have made our website completely responsive for seamless experience across all devices.


Our website is hosted through webhost hostinger and all the codes are provided here in my github account. Hope you all liked our project. 
#### Thank you Ureck-A-thon and Ureckon coding team for letting us showcase our innovative project.
