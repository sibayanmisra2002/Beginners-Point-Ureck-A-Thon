            <h2>12.1 File Pointers and <tt>fopen</tt></h2>
            <p>How will we specify that we want to access a particular data file?
                It would theoretically be possible
                to mention the name of a file
                each time it was desired to read from or write to it.
                But such an approach would have a number of drawbacks.
                
                Instead,
                the usual approach
                (and the one taken in C's stdio library)
                is that you mention the name of the file once,
                at the time you <dfn>open</dfn> it. <br> <br>
                Thereafter, you use some little
                token--in
                this case,
                the <dfn>file pointer</dfn>--which
                keeps track
                (both for your sake and the library's)
                of which file you're talking about. <br>
                Whenever you want to
                read from or write to
                one of the files you're working with,
                you identify that file
                by using its file pointer
                (that is, the file pointer you obtained when you opened the file).
                As we'll see, you store file pointers in variables
                just as you store any other data you manipulate,
                so
                it
                is possible to have several files open,
                as long as you use distinct variables to store the file pointers.
            </p><p>You declare a variable to store a file pointer like this:</p>
            <div class="code">
				<code>  
                    FILE *fp;<br>
			</code><br>
			 </div>
            The type <tt>FILE</tt> is codedefined for you by
            <tt>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</tt>. 
            <p>It is a data structure which holds the information
            the standard I/O library needs to keep track of
            the file for you.
            For historical reasons,
            you declare a variable which is a pointer to this <tt>FILE</tt> type.
            The name of the variable can
            (as for any variable)
            be anything you choose;
            it is traditional to use the letters <tt>fp</tt> in the variable name
            (since we're talking about a <tt>f</tt>ile <tt>p</tt>ointer).
            If you were reading from two files at once
            you'd probably use two file pointers:</p>
            <div class="code">
				<code>  
                    FILE *fp1, *fp2;<br>
			</code><br>
			 </div>
             If you were reading from one file and writing to another
            you might declare
            and input file pointer and an output file pointer:
            <div class="code">
				<code>  
                    FILE *ifp, *ofp;<br> 
			</code><br>
			 </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>Like any pointer variable,
                a file pointer isn't any good until it's initialized to point to something.
                (Actually, no variable of any type is much good until you've initialized it.)
                To actually open a file,
                and receive the ``token''
                which you'll store in your file pointer variable,
                you call <tt>fopen</tt>.
                <tt>fopen</tt> accepts a file name (as a string)
                and a <dfn>mode</dfn> value
                indicating among other things whether you intend to read or write this file.
                (The mode variable is also a string.)
                To open the file <tt>input.dat</tt> for reading you might call
            </p>
            <div class="code">
				<code>  
                    ifp = fopen("input.dat", "r");<br> 
			</code><br>
			 </div>
             The mode string <tt>"r"</tt> indicates reading.
            Mode <tt>"w"</tt> indicates writing,
            so we could open <tt>output.dat</tt> for  
            output like this:
            <div class="code">
				<code>  
                    ofp = fopen("output.dat", "w");<br>
			</code><br>
			 </div>
            The other values for the mode string are less frequently used.
            The third major mode is <tt>"a"</tt> for append.
            (If you use <tt>"w"</tt> to write to a file which already exists,
            its old contents will be discarded.) <br>
            You may also add a <tt>+</tt> character
            to the mode string
            to indicate that you want to both read and write,
            or a <tt>b</tt> character
            to indicate that you want to do ``binary''
            (as opposed to text)
            I/O.
            <p></p>
            <p>One thing to beware of when opening files
                is that it's an operation which may fail.
                The requested file might not exist,
                or it might be protected against reading or writing.
                (These possibilities ought to be obvious,
                but it's easy to forget them.) <br>
                <tt>fopen</tt> returns a null pointer if it can't open the requested file,
                and it's important to check for this case
                before going off and using <tt>fopen</tt>'s return value as a file pointer.
                Every call to <tt>fopen</tt> will typically be followed with a test,
                like this:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    ifp = fopen("input.dat", "r"); <br>
                    &emsp;if(ifp == NULL) { <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;    printf("can't open file\n"); <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;    <i>exit or return</i> <br>
                        &emsp;    }<br>
			</code><br>
			 </div>
            If <tt>fopen</tt> returns a null pointer,
            and you store it in your file pointer variable
            and go off and try to do I/O with it,
            your program will typically crash.
            <p></p>
            <p>It's common to collapse the call to <tt>fopen</tt>
                and
                the assignment
                in with
                the test:
            </p>
            <div class="code">
				<code>	
                    if((ifp = fopen("input.dat", "r")) == NULL) { <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;printf("can't open file\n"); <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;<i>exit or return</i> <br>
                    }
            </code>
			 </div>
            <br>

            <h2>12.2 I/O with File Pointers</h2>
            <p>For each of the I/O library functions we've been using so far,
                there's a companion function
                which accepts an additional file pointer argument
                telling it where to read from or write to. <br>
                The companion function to <tt>printf</tt> is <tt>fprintf</tt>,
                and the file pointer argument comes first.

            <h2>12.3 codedefined Streams</h2>
            <p>Besides the file pointers which we explicitly open by calling <tt>fopen</tt>,
                there are also three codedefined streams.
                <tt>stdin</tt> is a constant file pointer corresponding to standard input,
                and <tt>stdout</tt> is
                a constant file pointer corresponding to standard output. <br>
                Both of these can be used anywhere a file pointer is called for;
                for example,
                <tt>getchar()</tt> is the same as <tt>getc(stdin)</tt>
                and <tt>putchar(c)</tt> is the same as <tt>putc(c, stdout)</tt>.
                The third codedefined stream is <tt>stderr</tt>.
                Like <tt>stdout</tt>,
                <tt>stderr</tt> is typically connected to the screen by default.
                The difference is that <tt>stderr</tt> is not redirected
                when the standard output is redirected.
                For example,
                under Unix or MS-DOS,
                when you invoke
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        program &gt; filename
                    </code><br>
                 </div>
                anything printed to <tt>stdout</tt>
                is redirected to the file <tt>filename</tt>,
                but anything printed to <tt>stderr</tt> still goes to the screen.
                The intent behind <tt>stderr</tt> is
                that it is the ``standard error output'';
                error messages printed to it will not disappear into an output file.
                For example,
                a more realistic way to print an error message
                when a file can't be opened would be
                <div class="code">
                    <code>	if((ifp = fopen(filename, "r")) == NULL) <br>
                        { <br>
                        fprintf(stderr, "can't open file %s\n", filename); <br>
                        <i>exit or return</i> <br>
                        } <br>
                </code>
                 </div>where <tt>filename</tt> is a string variable
                indicating the file name to be opened.
                Not only is the error message printed to <tt>stderr</tt>,
                but it is also more informative
                in that it mentions the name of the file that couldn't be opened.
            <br>

            <h2>12.4 Closing Files</h2>
            <p>Although you can
                open multiple files,
                
                there's a limit to how many you can have open at once.
                If your program will open many files in succession,
                you'll want to close each one as you're done with it;
                otherwise the standard I/O library could run out of
                the resources it uses to keep track of open files.
                Closing a file simply involves
                calling <tt>fclose</tt> with the file pointer as its argument:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        fclose(fp);
                    </code><br>
                 </div>
                Calling <tt>fclose</tt> arranges that
                (if the file was open for output)
                any last, buffered output is finally written to the file,
                and that those resources used by the operating system
                (and the C library)
                for this file are released.
                If you forget to close a file,

            <h2>12.5 Example: Reading a Data File</h2>
            <p>Suppose you had a data file consisting of rows and columns of numbers:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>	
                        &emsp;&emsp;1	&emsp;&emsp;2	&emsp;&emsp;34 <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;5	&emsp;&emsp;6	&emsp;&emsp;78 <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;9	&emsp;&emsp;10	&emsp;&emsp;112 <br>
                    </code>
                 </div>
                Suppose you wanted to read these numbers into an array.
                (Actually, the array will be an array of arrays,
                or a ``multidimensional'' array;
                see section 4.1.2.)
                We can write code to do this by putting together several pieces:
                the <tt>fgetline</tt> function we just showed,
                and the <tt>getwords</tt> function from chapter 10.
                Assuming that the data file is named <tt>input.dat</tt>,
                the code would look like this:
                <div class="code">
                    <code>
                        #define MAXLINE 100 <br>
                        #define MAXROWS 10 <br>
                        #define MAXCOLS 10 <br>
                         <br>
                        int array[MAXROWS][MAXCOLS]; <br>
                        char *filename = "input.dat"; <br>
                        FILE *ifp; <br>
                        char line[MAXLINE]; <br>
                        char *words[MAXCOLS]; <br>
                        int nrows = 0; <br>
                        int n; <br>
                        int i; <br>
                         <br>
                        ifp = fopen(filename, "r"); <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;if(ifp == NULL) <br>
                        &emsp;&emsp;    { <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    fprintf(stderr, "can't open %s\n", filename); <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    exit(EXIT_FAILURE); <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;    } <br>
                         <br>
                         &emsp; &emsp;while(fgetline(ifp, line, MAXLINE) != EOF) <br>
                         &emsp;&emsp;    { <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    if(nrows &gt;= MAXROWS) <br>
                            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       { <br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;        fprintf(stderr, "too many rows\n"); <br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       exit(EXIT_FAILURE); <br>
                                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       } <br>
                         <br>
                        &emsp;    n = getwords(line, words, MAXCOLS); <br>
                         <br>
                         &emsp;&emsp;    for(i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) <br>
                         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;       array[nrows][i] = atoi(words[i]); <br>
                         &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;    nrows++; <br>
                         &emsp;&emsp;   } <br>
                        </code>
                 </div>
                 Each trip through the loop reads one line from the file,
                using <tt>fgetline</tt>.
                Each line is broken up into ``words'' using <tt>getwords</tt>;
                each ``word'' is actually one number.
                The numbers are however still recodesented as strings,
                so each one is converted to an <tt>int</tt> by calling <tt>atoi</tt>
                before being stored in the array. <br>
                The code checks for two different error conditions
                (failure to open the input file,
                and too many lines in the input file)
                and if one of these conditions occurs,
                it prints an error message, and exits.
                The <tt>exit</tt> function is a Standard library function
                which terminates your program.
                It is declared in <tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt>,
                and accepts one argument,
                which will be the <dfn>exit status</dfn> of the program.
                <tt>EXIT_FAILURE</tt> is a code,
                also defined by
                <tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt>,
                which indicates that the program failed.
                Success is indicated by a code of <tt>EXIT_SUCCESS</tt>, or simply 0.
                (These values can also be returned from <tt>main()</tt>;
                calling <tt>exit</tt> with a particular status value
                is
                essentially equivalent
                to returning that same status value from <tt>main</tt>.)
