        <h2>4.1 Visibility and Lifetime (Global Variables, etc.)</h2>
            
            <p>We haven't said so explicitly,
            but variables are channels of communication within a program.
            You set a variable to a value at one point in a program,
            and at another point (or points) you read the value out again.
            The two points may be in adjoining statements,
            or they may be in widely separated parts of the program.
            </p> <br><p>How long does a variable last?
            How widely separated can the setting and fetching parts of the program be,
            and how long after a variable is set does it persist?
            Depending on the variable
            and how you're using it,
            you might want different answers to
            these questions.
            </p> <br><p>The <dfn>visibility</dfn> of a variable determines how much of
            the rest of the program can access that variable.
            You can arrange that a variable is visible
            only within one part of one function,
            or in one function,
            or in one source file,
            or
            anywhere in the program.
            (We haven't really talked about source files yet; we'll be
            exploring them soon.)
            </p> <br><p>Why would you want to limit the visibility of a variable?
            For maximum flexibility, wouldn't it be handy if all variables
            were potentially visible everywhere?
            As it happens, that arrangement would be <em>too</em> flexible:
            everywhere in the program, you would have to keep track of the
            names of all the variables declared anywhere else in the program,
            so that you didn't accidentally re-use one.
            Whenever a variable had the wrong value by mistake, you'd have
            to search the entire program for the bug, because any statement
            in the entire program could potentially have modified that variable.
            You would constantly be stepping all over yourself by using a
            common variable name like <tt>i</tt> in two parts of your program,
            and having one snippet of code accidentally overwrite the
            values being used by another part of the code.
            The communication would be sort of like an old party
            line--you'd always be accidentally interrupting other
            conversations, or having your conversations interrupted.
            </p> <br><p>To avoid this confusion,
            we generally give variables the narrowest or smallest
            visibility they need.
            A variable declared within the braces <tt>{}</tt> of a function
            is visible only within that function;
            variables declared within functions are called <dfn>local variables</dfn>.
            If another function somewhere else declares a local variable
            with the same name, it's a different variable entirely,
            
            and the two don't
            clash
            
            with each other.
            </p> <br><p>On the other hand, a variable declared outside of any function
            is a <dfn>global variable</dfn>, and it is potentially visible anywhere
            within the program.
            You use global variables when you <em>do</em> want the communications path
            to be able to travel to any part of the program.
            When you declare a global variable, you will usually give it a
            longer, more descriptive name
            (not something generic like <tt>i</tt>)
            so that whenever you use it you will remember that it's the
            same variable everywhere.
            
            </p> <br><p>Another word for the visibility of variables is <dfn>scope</dfn>.
            </p> <br><p>How long do variables last?
            By default, local variables
            (those declared within a function)
            have <dfn>automatic duration</dfn>:
            they spring into existence when the function is called,
            and they (and their values) disappear when the function returns.
            Global variables, on the other hand, have <dfn>static duration</dfn>:
            they last, and the values stored in them persist,
            for as long as the program does.
            (Of course, the values can in general still be overwritten,
            so they don't necessarily persist forever.)
            
            </p> <br><p>Finally, it is possible to split a function up into several
            source files, for easier maintenance.
            When several source files are combined into one program
            (we'll be seeing how in the next chapter)
            the compiler must have a way of correlating the global
            variables which might be used to communicate between the
            several source files.
            
            Furthermore, if a global variable is going to be useful for communication,
            there must be exactly one of it:
            you wouldn't want one function in one source file
            to store a value in one global variable named <tt>globalvar</tt>,
            and then have another function in another source file
            read from a <em>different</em> global variable named <tt>globalvar</tt>.
            Therefore,
            a global variable should
            have exactly one <dfn>defining instance</dfn>,
            in one place in one source file.
            If the same variable is to be used anywhere else
            (i.e. in some other source file or files),
            the variable is declared
            in those other file(s)
            with an <dfn>external declaration</dfn>,
            which is not a defining instance.
            The external declaration says,
            ``hey, compiler,
            here's the name and type of a global variable I'm going to use,
            but don't define it here,
            don't allocate space for it;
            it's one that's defined somewhere else,
            and I'm just referring to it here.''
            If you accidentally have two distinct defining instances for a
            variable of the same name,
            the compiler (or the linker) will complain that it is
            ``multiply defined.''
            </p> <br><p>It is also possible to have a variable which is global in the
            sense that it is declared outside of any function,
            but private to the one source file it's defined in.
            Such a variable is visible to the functions in that source file
            
            but not to any functions in any other source files,
            even if they try to issue a matching declaration.
            </p> <br><p>You get any extra control you might need over visibility and
            lifetime, and you distinguish between defining instances and
            external declarations, by
            using
            <dfn>storage classes</dfn>.
            A storage class is an extra keyword
            at the beginning of
            a declaration
            which modifies the declaration in some way.
            Generally, the storage class
            (if any)
            is the first word in the declaration,
            preceding the type name.
            (Strictly speaking,
            this ordering has not traditionally been necessary,
            and you may see some code
            with the storage class, type name,
            and other parts of a declaration
            in an unusual order.)
            </p> <br><p>We said that, by default, local variables had automatic duration.
            To give them static duration
            (so that, instead of coming and going as the function is
            called, they persist for as long as the function does),
            you precede their declaration with the <tt>static</tt> keyword:
            </p> <br><div class="code"><code>	static int i;
            </code></div>
            <p></p> <br><p>By default, a declaration of a global variable
            (especially if it specifies an initial value)
            is the defining instance.
            To make it an external declaration,
            of a variable which is defined somewhere else,
            you
            precede it with the keyword <tt>extern</tt>:
            </p> <br><div class="code"><code>	extern int j;
            </code></div>
            
            <p></p> <br><p>Finally, to arrange that a global variable is visible only
            within its containing source file,
            you
            precede it with the <tt>static</tt> keyword:
            </p> <br><div class="code"><code>	static int k;
            </code></div>
            
            <p></p> <br><p>Notice that the <tt>static</tt> keyword
            can do
            
            two different things:
            it adjusts the duration of a local variable from automatic to
            static, or it adjusts the visibility of a global variable from
            truly global to private-to-the-file.
            </p> <br><p>To summarize, we've talked about two different attributes of a
            variable: visibility and duration.
            These are orthogonal,
            as shown in this table:
            </p> <br><p>
            </p> <br><table border="">
            <tbody><tr><td></td><td colspan="2" align="center">duration:</td></tr>
            <tr><td>visibility:</td><td align="center">automatic</td><td align="center">static</td></tr>
            <tr><td>local</td><td>normal local variables</td><td><tt>static</tt> local variables</td></tr>
            <tr><td>global</td><td>N/A</td><td>normal global variables</td></tr>
            </tbody></table>
            <p>
            We can also distinguish between file-scope global
            variables and truly global variables, based on the presence or
            absence of the <tt>static</tt> keyword.
            </p> <br><p>We can also distinguish between external declarations and
            defining instances of
            global variables, based on the presence or absence of the
            <tt>extern</tt> keyword.
            </p> 
             <h2>4.2 Default Initialization</h2>
                
                <p>The duration of a variable
                (whether static or automatic)
                also affects its default initialization.
                </p> <br><p>If you do not explicitly initialize them,
                automatic-duration variables
                (that is, local, non-<tt>static</tt> ones)
                are not guaranteed to have any particular initial value;
                they will typically contain garbage.
                It is therefore a fairly serious error
                to attempt to use the value of an automatic variable
                which has never been initialized or assigned to:
                the program will either work incorrectly,
                or the garbage value may just happen to be ``correct''
                such that the program appears to work correctly!
                However,
                the particular value that the garbage takes on can vary
                depending literally on <em>anything</em>:
                other parts of the program,
                which compiler was used,
                which hardware or operating system the program is running on,
                the time of day,
                the phase of the moon.
                (Okay, maybe the phase of the moon is a bit of an exaggeration.)
                So you hardly want to say that a program
                which uses an uninitialized variable ``works'';
                it may seem to work,
                but it works for the wrong reason,
                and it may stop working tomorrow.
                </p> <br><p>Static-duration variables (global and <tt>static</tt> local),
                on the other hand,
                are guaranteed to be initialized to 0
                if you do not use an explicit initializer in the definition.
                </p> <br><p>(Once upon a time,
                there was another distinction between
                the initialization of automatic vs. static variables:
                you could initialize <dfn>aggregate</dfn> objects,
                such as arrays,
                only
                if they had static duration.
                If your compiler complains when you try to initialize a local array,
                it's probably an old, pre-ANSI compiler.
                Modern, ANSI-compatible compilers remove this limitation,
                so it's no longer much of a
                concern.)

                        even if they try to issue external declarations for it.
                        (If other source files try to declare
                        
                        a global variable called

                        they won't be sharing this one.)
                        Since it has static duration and receives no explicit initialization,

                        it will be initialized to 2
                        each time <tt>f()</tt> is called.
                        </p> <br><p>Finally, <tt>persistentvar</tt> is again local to <tt>f()</tt>,
                        but it <em>does</em> maintain its value between calls to <tt>f()</tt>.
                        It has static duration but no explicit initializer,
                        so its initial value will be 0.
                        </p> <br><p>The defining instances and external declarations we've been
                        looking at so far have all been of simple variables.
                        There are also defining instances and external declarations of
                        functions, which we'll be looking at in the next chapter.
                        </p> <br><p>(Also, don't worry about static variables for now
                        if they don't make sense to you;
                        they're a relatively sophisticated concept,
                        which you won't need to use at first.)
                        </p> <br><p>The term <dfn>declaration</dfn> is a general one which
                        encompasses defining instances and external declarations;
                        defining instances and external declarations are two different
                        kinds of declarations.
                        Furthermore, either kind of declaration suffices to inform the
                        compiler of the name and type of a particular variable (or function).
                        If you have the defining instance of a global variable in a
                        source file, the rest of that source file can use that variable
                        without having to issue any external declarations.
                        It's only in source files where the defining instance hasn't
                        been seen that you need external declarations.
                        </p> <br><p>You will sometimes hear a defining instance referred to simply
                        as a ``definition,''
                        and
                        you will sometimes hear an external declaration referred to simply
                        as a ``declaration.''
                        These usages are mildly ambiguous, in that you can't tell out
                        of context whether a ``declaration'' is a generic
                        declaration
                        (that might be a defining instance or an external declaration)
                        or whether it's an external declaration that specifically is
                        not a defining instance.
                        (Similarly, there are other constructions that can be called
                        ``definitions'' in C, namely the definitions of
                        preprocessor macros, structures, and typedefs, none of which
                        we've met.)
                        In these notes, we'll try to make things clear by using the
                        unambiguous terms <dfn>defining instance</dfn>
                        and <dfn>external declaration</dfn>.
                        Elsewhere,
                        
                        you may have to look at the context to determine how
                        the terms ``definition'' and
                        ``declaration'' are being used.
