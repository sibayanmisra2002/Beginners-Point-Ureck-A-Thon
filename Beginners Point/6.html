    <h2>6.1 Introduction</h2>
    </header> 
              <p>For carrying out an arithmetic calculation using C, there is
  no way other than writing a program, which is equivalent to
  using a pocket calculator. Different outcomes are obtained
  when different values are assigned to variables involved in
  the arithmetic calculation.
  Hence, there is a need to read values into variables as
  the program runs. Notice the words here: ‘as the program
  runs’. Values can be stored in variables using the assignment
  operator. For example, a=100; stores 100 in the variable a
  each time the program is run, no matter what the program
  does. Without some sort of input command, every program
  would produce exactly the same result every time it is run. <br> <br>
  This would certainly make debugging easy. But in practice,
  of course, the user may need programs to do different jobs that give different outcomes each time they are run. For this
  purpose, C has been provided with some input instructions
  that are in fact a set of functions. For the present, it may be
  said that a function is a code segment that is complete in
  itself and does some particular task as and when it is called.
  When a program is in execution, each of its statements are
  executed one after the other or in a particular order. When
  this process of execution reaches an input instruction, also
  referred to as an input statement, the most common being the
  scanf() function, the program execution pauses to give the
  user time to enter something on the keyboard. <br> <br> The execution
  of the program continues only after the user enters some data
  (or nothing) and presses <b>[Enter] or [Return]</b>  to signal that
  the procedure of entering input data has been completed. The
  program execution then continues with the inputted value stored in the memory location reserved for the variable. In
  this way, each time the program is run, users get a chance to
  type in different values for the variable and the program also
  gets a chance to produce different results.
  The final missing piece in the jigsaw is using an output
  command or statement, the commonly used one being the
  printf() function, the one that has already been used in some
  example programs in the previous chapter, to print the value
  currently stored in a variable.</p> <br> 
  <p>In the context of the above example, it should be
  understood that the input function, scanf(), is used to read
  the data entered through the keyboard. On the other hand, the
  printf() function is used to display the data on the screen.
  The original C specification did not include commands for
  input and output. Instead, the compiler writers were supposed
  to implement library functions to suit their machines. In
  practice, all chose to implement printf() and scanf()
  and, after a while, C programmers started to think of these
  functions as I/O keywords. It sometimes helps to remember
  that they are functions like any other function. <br> <br> 
  To make C a more uniform language, it has been provided
  with standard libraries of functions that perform common
  tasks. Though these libraries are termed standard but until
  the ANSI committee actually produced a standard, there
  was, and still is, some variation in what the standard libraries
  contained and exactly how the functions worked. However,
  in practice, the situation is not that bad; most of the functions
  that are used frequently are standard on all implementations.
  In particular the input and output functions vary very little.
  This chapter will, therefore, primarily consider input
  functions that read data from the keyboard and output
  functions that display data on the screen.
  </p> 
  
       <h2> 6.2 Basic Screen and Keyboard I/O in C </h2>
  <p>C provides several functions that give different levels of
  input and output capability. These functions are, in most
  cases, implemented as routines that call lower-level input/
  output functions.
  The input and output functions in C are built around the
  concept of a set of standard data streams being connected
  from each executing program to the basic input/output
  devices. These standard data streams or files are opened
  by the operating system and are available to every C and
  assembler program for use without having to open or close
  the files. These standard files or streams are called </p> <br>
  <p><div> 
          <div class="code1">
          <code> &emsp;(a) stdin : connected to the keyboard<br>
  &emsp;(b) stdout : connected to the screen<br>
  &emsp;(c) stderr : connected to the screen<br>
  </code></div></br></b></p> <br>
  <p>The following two data streams are also available on MS-
  DOS-based computers, but not on UNIX or other multi-user-
    based operating systems.</p> <br><div> 
          <div class="code1">
          <code> &emsp;(a) stdaux: connected to the first serial communications port<br>
  &emsp;(b) stdprn: connected to the first parallel printer port<br>
  </code></div></br></b></p> <br>
  <p>A number of functions and macros exist to provide support
  for streams of various kinds. The <stdio.h> header file
  contains the various declarations necessary for the functions,
  together with the macros and type declarations needed for the
  input and output functions. The input/output functions fall
  into two categories: non-formatted read (input) and display
  (output) functions and formatted read (input) and display
  (output) functions.
  </p> 
    <h2>6.3 Non-formatted Input and Output</h2>
  <p>Non-formatted input and output can be carried out by standard
  input–output library functions in C. These can handle one
  character at a time. For the input functions, it does not require
  <b>[Enter]</b> to be pressed after the entry of the character. For
  output functions, it prints a single character on the console.</p> <br>
  
  
  
  
  
  
    <h3>6.3.1 Single Character Input and Output</h3>
  <p>A number of functions provide for character-oriented input
  and output. The declaration formats of two of these are given
  as follows: <br>
  <p><br><div> 
          <div class="code1">
          <code> &emsp;int getchar(void);<br>
     &emsp;//function for character input<br>
     &emsp;int putchar(int c);<br>
     //function of character output</code></div></br></b></p> <br>
    <tt>getchar()</tt> is an input function that reads a single character
  from the standard input device, normally a keyboard.
    <tt>putchar()</tt> is an output function that writes a single character
  on the standard output device, the display screen.
    There are two other functions, <tt>gets() and puts()</tt>, that are
  used to read and write strings from and to the keyboard and
  the display screen, respectively. A string may be defined as
  an arranged collection of characters. These two functions will
  be dealt with in greater detail in the chapter on arrays and
  strings.</p> <br>
  
  
  
  
  <h3>6.3.2 Single Character Input</h3>
    <p>The <tt>getchar()</tt> input function reads an unsigned char from
  the input stream stdin. The character obtained from the input
  stream is treated as an unsigned char and is converted to an
  int, which is the return value. On end of file, the constant EOF
  is returned and the end-of-file indicator is set for the associated
  stream. On error, the error indicator is set for the stream.
  Successive calls will obtain characters sequentially.
  To read a single character from the keyboard, the general
  form of the statement used to call the getchar() function is
  given as follows: <br>
    <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> &emsp; char_variable = getchar();<br></div><br></b></code>
  where char_variable is the name of a variable of type char.
      The <tt>getchar()</tt> input function receives the character data
  entered through the keyboard and places it in the memory
  location allotted to the variable char_variable. The code <br>
  <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> &emsp;int ch;<br>
      &emsp;ch = getchar();</div><br></code></b>
  places the character read from the keyboard in the lower byte
  of the variable named <tt>ch</tt>. It has to be noted here that getchar() reads a single
  character from the input data stream, but does not return
  the character to the program until the ‘\n’ (<b> [Return] or
  [Enter] </b>) key is pressed.
  There is an important observation that has to be made
  about the <tt>ch = getchar();</tt> function. Though the data
  entered through the keyboard is perceived to be of character
  type, the data is actually stored as an integer. Here, this
  integer is the variable <tt>ch</tt>. This is because everytime<tt>
  ch = getchar()</tt>; reads a data from the keyboard, it checks
  whether it is a character data or an <tt>EOF</tt>. The problem is
  distinguishing the end of input from valid data. The solution
  is that <tt>getchar()</tt> returns a distinctive value when there is no
  more input, a value that cannot be confused with any real
  character. This value is called <tt>EOF</tt>, i.e., end of file. So ch must
  be declared to be of a type big enough to hold any value that
  <tt>getchar()</tt> returns. Therefore, <tt>char</tt> cannot be used since <tt>ch</tt>
  must be big enough to hold <tt>EOF</tt> in addition to any possible <tt>
  char</tt>. Therefore, <tt>int</tt> is used.</p> <br>
   <h3> 6.3.3 Single Character Output</h3>
  <p>The <tt>putchar()</tt> function is identical in description to the
  <tt>getchar()</tt> function except the following difference. <tt>putchar()</tt> writes a character to the stdout data stream. On success,
  <tt>putchar()</tt> returns the character. On error, <tt>putchar()</tt> returns
  <tt>EOF</tt>. There is no equivalent to end of file for an output file.
  To write a single character on the screen, the general form of
  the statement used to call the <tt>putchar()</tt> function is given as
  follows: <br> <br>
  <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> putchar(char_variable);</div></code></br></b>
  where <tt>char_variable</tt> is the name of a variable that is of
  type <tt>char</tt>. The character data stored in the memory location
  allotted to the variable <tt>char_variable</tt> is displayed on the
  display screen.
  The following program code displays the character entered
  through <tt>getchar()</tt> on the screen.It has to be noted that the character ‘x’ remains stored in
  the lower order byte of <tt>ch</tt> even after <tt>putchar(ch)</tt> copies it
  and displays it on the monitor screen.</p> <br> 
  <h3>6.3.4 Character Input and Output Functions</h3>
  <p>Other than <tt>getchar()</tt> and <tt>putchar()</tt>, there are some more
  single character input and output functions that are available
  in Turbo C only. These are as follows: <br>
  <tt>getch()</tt> This input function reads, without echoing on the
  screen, a single character from the keyboard and immediately
  returns that character to the program. General statement
  form: <br>
  <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> &emsp;  ch = getch(); /* ‘ch’ is a character variable */</div></code></br></b>
  <tt>getche()</tt> This input function reads, with echo on the screen,
  a single character from the keyboard and immediately returns
  that character to the program. General statement form: <br>
  <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> &emsp;  ch = getche(); /* ‘ch’ is a character variable */</div></code></br></b>
  <tt>putch()</tt> This output function writes the character directly
  to the screen. On success, the function <tt>putch()</tt> returns the
  character printed. On error, it returns <tt>EOF</tt>. General statement
  form: <br>
  <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> &emsp;  putch(ch); /* ‘ch’ is a character variable */</div></code></br></b>
  When used in programs, the above functions require the
  header file <tt>conio.h</tt> to be included. It should be noted here
  that the data held by the variable in all the input and output
  functions are in ASCII value. <br>
  <div>
          <div class="code1">
            <code> 1.<tt>getchar()</tt>: the single character input function, reads a
  one byte character input from the keyboard and stores it in the lower order byte of an integer variable. <br> <br>
  2.<tt>putchar()</tt>:the single character output function, displays
    a one-byte character on the monitor screen.</tt></div></code></br></b>
   
  <h3>6.3.5  Examples </h3>
  <h4>1. Double the output of next two characters from the ASCII table.</h4> <br>
  <div>
    <div class="code1">
      <code>
    &emsp;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
    &emsp;int main(void)<br>
    &emsp;{<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;int ch;<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;ch=getchar();<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;putchar(++ch); /* first putchar() */<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;putchar(ch++); /* second putchar()*/<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;putchar(ch); /* third putchar() */<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;putchar(ch––); /* fourth putchar()*/<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;putchar(ch); /* fifth putchar() */<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
    &emsp;}<br>
  </code></div></b> <br> 
  <div class="output"> <code>
    (i) <b>Input</b> a<br>
    <b>Output</b> bbccb<br>
    (ii) <b>Input</b> h<br>
    <b>Output</b> iijji</br></div>
  </code></div> <br>
  <p><b>Explanation:</b> Here when the program is executed, <tt>getchar()</tt>
  obtains the typed-in character and places its ASCII equivalent in the
  integer variable <tt>ch</tt>. As shown, the typed-in character is chosen to
  be <tt>a</tt>. Next, in the first <tt>putchar()</tt>, at the beginning, the content
  of <tt>ch</tt> is incremented by 1 to represent <tt>b</tt>, then this is displayed
  on the monitor screen. In the second <tt>putchar()</tt>, the content
  of <tt>ch</tt>,which is <tt>b</tt>, is displayed on the monitor screen and then its
  content is incremented by 1 to represent <tt>c</tt> in ASCII. In the third
  <tt>putchar()</tt>, the content of <tt>ch</tt>, which is <tt>c</tt>, is displayed on the
  monitor screen and the content in ch does not get altered. During the
  fourth <tt>putchar()</tt>, the content in <tt>ch</tt>, which is <tt>c</tt>, is first displayed
  on the monitor screen and then the content in <tt>ch</tt> is decremented
  to represent <tt>b</tt> in ASCII. Therefore, during the fifth <tt>putchar()</tt>, the
  content of <tt>ch</tt> is displayed as <tt>b</tt> on the monitor screen.
  Similar result is obtained when the program is run for the second
  time with <tt>h</tt> as the input data.</p> <br>
  <p><br>
    <h4>2. Compare two numbers.</h4> <br>
    <div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code>
    &emsp;#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;<br>
    &emsp;#include &lt;conio.h&gt;<br>
    &emsp;int main(void)<br>
    &emsp;{<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int a=2,b=5;<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int t,f,x;<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;t=getchar();<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;fflush(stdin); /* the fflush() function clears */<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* the input stream stdin */<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;f=getchar();<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;x=((a>b)?t:f);<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;putchar(x);<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;putch(x);<br>
    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
    &emsp;}</code></div><br>
    <div class="output">
      <code>
        <b>Input</b> 1<br>
        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;0<br>
        <b>Output</b> 00 </br>
      </code>
    </div> <br>
  <b>Explanation:</b> In this example, the character entered in variable
  t is 1 while that for f is 0. During evaluation of the expression
  x=((a>b)?t:f), the relation a > b is found to be false, so f
  is assigned to x. Since f contains 0, thus x is assigned this
  character 0. Therefore, putchar(x) displays a 0 on the monitor
  screen. Since there is no new-line command following the display
  of 0, the cursor positions itself next to this character. Now, when
  <tt>putch(x)</tt> is executed, it displays the value in x at the cursor
  positioned next to the earlier display. So the output finally appears
  as 00.</p>
  <h2>6.4 Formatted Input and Output Functions</h2>
  <p>When input and output is required in a specified format, the
  standard library functions <tt>scanf() and printf()</tt> are used. The
  <tt>scanf()</tt> function allows the user to input data in a specified
    format. It can accept data of different data types.</p> <br>
  <h3>6.4.1 Output Function print f ( )</h3>
  <p>The <tt>printf()</tt> [and <tt>scanf()</tt>] functions differ from the kind of functions that are created by the programmer as they can take a variable number of parameters. In the case of <tt>printf()</tt>,
  the first parameter is always a control string, for example,
  ‘Hello World’, but after that the programmer can include any
  number of parameters of any type. The general form of a call
  to the printf() function is <p><div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> printf(“control_string”,variable1,variable2,
   variable3,...); </div></code></br></b></p> <br>
  <p>where ‘...’ means a list of variables that can be written separated
  by commas and this list may be as long as is desired. The
  control string is all-important because it specifies the type of
  each variable in the list and how the user wants it printed. The
  control string is also called the <tt>format string.</tt>
  The <i>control string</i>, which is written within “and”, contains
  <i>data type</i> with <i>format specifiers</i> indicated by the characters
  that follow the % symbol. These are arranged in order so
  that they correspond to the respective variables. In between
  the % symbol with the specifiers, character strings may be
  inserted. When the <tt>printf()</tt> function executes, it scans the
  control string from left to right and prints out the character
  string as it is while printing the values of the listed variables
  according to the information specified with the respective
  format specifiers. For example,<p><div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code> printf(“Hello World”);</div></code></br></p> <br></b>
  has a control string only and has no % characters. The above
  statement displays Hello World only. The format specifier %d
  means convert the next value to a signed decimal integer, and
  hence
  <p><div> 
          <div class="code1">
            <code>printf(“Total = %d”,total);</div></code></br></b>
  will print <tt>Total</tt> = and then the value passed by the variable
  named <tt>total</tt> as a decimal integer.</p> <br>
  <p> The C view of output is at a lower level than one might
  expect. The %d is known as a formatspecifier, while it also acts
  as a <i>conversion code</i>. It indicates the data type of the variable
  to be printed and how that data type should be converted to
  the characters that appear on the screen. Thus %d says that
  the next value to be printed is a signed integer value, i.e., a
  value that would be stored in a standard int variable, which
  should be converted into a sequence of characters, where
  digits represent the value in decimal. If by some accident
  the variable that is to be displayed happens to be a float or a
  double, then the user will still see a value displayed but it will
  not correspond to the actual value of the float or double.
  The reason for this is twofold.
  <ol><li>An int uses two bytes (considering 16-bit machine) to store
  its value, while a float uses four and a double uses eight.
  If an effort is made to display a float or a double using %d,
  then only the first two bytes of the value are actually used.</li>
  <li> Even if there was no size difference, int, float, and double
  use a different binary representation and %d expects the bit
  pattern to be a simple signed binary integer.
  This is all a bit technical, but that is in the nature of C.
  These details can be ignored as long as two important facts
  are remembered.</li>
  <li> The conversion code following % indicates the type of
  variable to be displayed as well as the format in which that
  value should be displayed.</li>
  <li> If the programmer uses a conversion code with the wrong
  type of variable, then some strange things will be seen on
  the screen and the error often propagates to other items in
  the <tt>printf()</tt> list.</li></ol>
  Though this appears a bit complicated, it should also be
  pointed out that the benefit lies in being able to treat what
  is stored in a variable in a more flexible way than other
  languages allow. In fact, the programmer need not know that
  the numeric number stored in a variable is in binary form.
  But while printing this number using the <tt>printf()</tt> function, it
  would appear to be a decimal number. Of course, whether this
  is viewed as an advantage depends on what the programmer
  is trying to do. It certainly brings the user closer to the way
  the machine works.</p> <br>
  <p> The format string in <tt>printf()</tt>, enclosed in quotation
  marks, has three types of objects:</p> <br>
  <p><ol><li><b>Ordinary characters</b> These are copied to output.</li>
  <b><li>Conversion specifier field</b> It is denoted by % containing the
  codes  and by optional modifiers such as
  width, precision, flag, and size.</li>
  <b><li>Control code</b> It includes optional control characters such
  as \n, \b, and \t.</li></ol></p> <br>
