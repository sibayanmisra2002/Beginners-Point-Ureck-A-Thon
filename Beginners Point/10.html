	<h2>C Pointers</h2>
	</header>

	<p>Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed
    more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be
    performed without using pointers. So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a
    perfect C programmer. Let's start learning them in simple and easy steps.</p><br>
    <p>As you know, every variable is a memory location and every memory location has its
    address defined which can be accessed using <strong>ampersand (&) </strong> operator, which denotes an
    address in memory. </p><br>
    <p>Consider the following example, which will print the address of the variables defined:</p><br>
    
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br> <br>
				&emsp;int main(void)<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int var1;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;char var2[10];<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Address of var1 variable: %x\n", &var1 );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Address of var2 variable: %x\n", &var2 );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
				&emsp;}<br>
				<br><br> </code>
			</div>
		</div><br>
		<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
		<br>
		<div class="output">
		<code> &emsp;<br>Address of var1 variable: bff5a400<br>
			 &emsp;<br>Address of var2 variable: bff5a3f6<br>
        <br> &emsp;<br></code>
      </div><br>
      <p>So you understood what is memory address and how to access it, so base of the concept is
      over. Now let us see what is a pointer.</p><br><br>
	       <div>
	       	<h2>What Are Pointers?</h2><br>
	       	<img src="images/pointers.png"class="ptr-img"
	       	width="50%"
	       	height="40%" />
			   <p>A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of
         the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before you
         can use it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is:</p>
	    
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;
				type *var-name;
			</code><br></div></div><br></section>
			<p>Here, type is the pointer's base type; it must be a valid C data type and var-name is the
      name of the pointer variable. The asterisk * you used to declare a pointer is the same
      asterisk that you use for multiplication. However, in this statement the asterisk is being
      used to designate a variable as a pointer. Following are the valid pointer declaration:</p>
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;int *ip;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* pointer to an integer */<br>
				&emsp;double *dp;&emsp;&emsp; /* pointer to a double */<br>
				&emsp;float *fp;&emsp;&emsp; /* pointer to a float */<br>
				&emsp;char *ch;&emsp;&emsp; /* pointer to a character */<br> </code>
				</div></div><br>
			<p>The actual data type of the value of all pointers, whether integer, float, character, or
      otherwise, is the same, a long hexadecimal number that represents a memory address. The
      only difference between pointers of different data types is the data type of the variable or
      constant that the pointer points to.</p>
		
		<div>
		<h2>How to use Pointers?</h2>
		<p>There are few important operations, which we will do with the help of pointers very
    frequently. <strong>(a)</strong> we define a pointer variable <strong>(b) </strong> the address of a variable to a
    pointer and <strong>(c) </strong>finally access the value at the address available in the pointer variable. This
    is done by using unary operator * that returns the value of the variable located at the
    address specified by its operand. Following example makes use of these operations:</p>
		
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br><br>
				&emsp;int main(void)<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;int var = 20;  &emsp; &emsp;/* actual variable declaration */<br>
				&emsp;int *ip; &emsp;  &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;/* pointer variable declaration */<br><br>
				&emsp;ip = &var; &emsp; &emsp;&emsp;/* store address of var in pointer variable*/<br><br>
				&emsp;printf("Address of var variable: %x\n", &var );<br><br>
				&emsp;/* address stored in pointer variable */<br>
				&emsp;printf("Address stored in ip variable: %x\n", ip );<br><br>
				&emsp;/* access the value using the pointer */<br>
				&emsp;printf("Value of *ip variable: %d\n", *ip );<br>
				&emsp;}<br><br> </code>
				</div></div><br>
			<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces result something as follows:</p><br>

    <div class="output">
		<code> &emsp;Address of var variable: bffd8b3c<br>
		&emsp;Address stored in ip variable: bffd8b3c<br>
	  &emsp;Value of *ip variable: 20<br></code>
      </div><br>
      <h3>Usage of pointer :</h3><br>
      <p>There are many applications of pointers in c language.</p><br>
      <div><ol>
      	<li><strong>Dynamic memory allocation</strong></li>
      	<p>In c language, we can dynamically allocate memory using malloc() and calloc() functions where the pointer is used.</p><br>
      	<li><strong>Arrays, Functions, and Structures</strong></li>
      	<p>Pointers in c language are widely used in arrays, functions, and structures. It reduces the code and improves the performance.</p></ol></div>

      	<h3>Advantage of pointer :</h3>
      	<div><ol><li> Pointer <strong>reduces the code</strong> and <strong>improves the performance</strong>, it is used to retrieving strings, trees, etc. and used with arrays, structures, and functions.</li>
      		<li> We can <strong>return multiple values from a function</strong> using the pointer.</li>
      		<li> It makes you able to<strong> access any memory location</strong> in the computer's memory.</li></ol></div>


   <h3>Pointer to array :</h3>
   <div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;int arr[10];  <br>
				&emsp;int *p[10]=&arr; // Variable p of type pointer is pointing to the address of an integer array arr.<br></code></div></div><br>
   <h3>Pointer to a function :</h3>
   <div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;void show (int);  <br>
				&emsp;void(*p)(int) = &display; // Pointer p is pointing to the address of a function <br></code></div></div><br>
   <h3>Pointer to structure :</h3>
      <div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;struct st<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; int i;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;float f;<br>
				&emsp;}ref;<br>
				&emsp;struct st *p = &ref;  
				<br><br> </code>
			</div>
		</div><br>
   

	<h2>NULL Pointers in C</h2>
	<p>It is always a good practice to assign a NULL value to a pointer variable in case you do not
  have exact address to be assigned. This is done at the time of variable declaration. A
  pointer that is assigned NULL is called a null pointer.</p><br><p>The NULL pointer is a constant with a value of zero defined in several standard libraries.<br>
  Consider the following program:</p><br>
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br><br>
				&emsp;int main()<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;int *ptr = NULL;<br> 
				&emsp;printf("The value of ptr is : %x\n", &ptr );<br>
				&emsp;return 0;<br>
				&emsp;}<br><br> </code>
				</div></div><br>
			  <p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p><br>

     <div class="output">
		 <code> &emsp;The value of ptr is 0<br></code></div><br>
		 <p>On most of the operating systems, programs are not permitted to access memory at
     address 0 because that memory is reserved by the operating system. However, the
     memory address 0 has special significance; it signals that the pointer is not intended to
     point to an accessible memory location. But by convention, if a pointer contains the null
    (zero) value, it is assumed to point to nothing.</p><br><p>To check for a null pointer you can use an if statement as follows:</p><br>
    <div>
				<div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;if(ptr) /* succeeds if p is not null */<br>
				&emsp;if(!ptr) /* succeeds if p is null */<br></code></div></div>

	<div>
		<h2>Pointer arithmetic</h2>
		<p>As explained in main chapter, C pointer is an address, which is a numeric value. Therefore,
    you can perform arithmetic operations on a pointer just as you can a numeric value. There
    are four arithmetic operators that can be used on pointers: ++, --, +, and -</p><br><p>To understand pointer arithmetic, let us consider that ptr is an integer pointer which points
    to the address 1000. Assuming 32-bit integers, let us perform the following arithmetic
    operation on the pointer:</p>
    <div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code>&emsp;ptr++<br></code></div></div><br>
    <p>Now, after the above operation, the <strong>ptr </strong>will point to the location 1004 because each time <strong>ptr </strong>is incremented, it will point to the next integer location which is 4 bytes next to the
    current location. This operation will move the pointer to next memory location without
    impacting actual value at the memory location. If <strong>ptr </strong> points to a character whose address
    is 1000, then above operation will point to the location 1001 because next character will beavailable at 1001.</p>

		<h2>Incrementing a Pointer</h2>
		<p>We prefer using a pointer in our program instead of an array because the variable pointer
    can be incremented, unlike the array name which cannot be incremented because it is a
    constant pointer. The following program increments the variable pointer to access each
    succeeding element of the array:</p>

			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br> <br>
        &emsp;const int MAX = 3;<br><br>
				&emsp;int main(void)<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int var[] = {10, 100, 200};<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int i, *ptr;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* let us have array address in pointer */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ptr = var;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for ( i = 0; i < MAX; i++)<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Address of var[%d] = %x\n", i, ptr );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Value of var[%d] = %d\n", i, *ptr );<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* move to the next location */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ptr++;<br>
				&emsp;}<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
				&emsp;}<br></code>
			</div>
		</div><br>
		<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
		<br>
		<div class="output">
		<code> Address of var[0] = bf882b30
			 &emsp;<br>Value of var[0] = 10
        &emsp;<br>Address of var[1] = bf882b34
        &emsp;<br>Value of var[1] = 100
        &emsp;<br>Address of var[2] = bf882b38
        &emsp;<br>Value of var[2] = 200<br></code>
      </div><br>
      <p>So you understood what is memory address and how to access it, so base of the concept is over. Now let us see what is a pointer.</p></div>

      <div>
		<h2>Decrementing a Pointer</h2>
		<p>We prefer using a pointer in our program instead of an array because the variable pointer
    can be incremented, unlike the array name which cannot be incremented because it is a
    constant pointer. The following program increments the variable pointer to access each
    succeeding element of the array:</p>
	
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br> <br>
        &emsp;const int MAX = 3;<br><br>
				&emsp;int main()<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int var[] = {10, 100, 200};<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int i, *ptr;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* let us have array address in pointer */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ptr = &var[MAX-1];<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for ( i = MAX; i > 0; i--)<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Address of var[%d] = %x\n", i, ptr );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Value of var[%d] = %d\n", i, *ptr );<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* move to the previous location */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ptr--;<br>
				&emsp;}<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
				&emsp;}<br></code>
			</div>
		</div><br>
		<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
		<br>
		<div class="output">
		<code> Address of var[0] = bfdbcb20
			 &emsp;<br>Value of var[0] = 10
        &emsp;<br>Address of var[1] = bfdbcb24
        &emsp;<br>Value of var[1] = 100
        &emsp;<br>Address of var[2] =bfdbcb28
        &emsp;<br>Value of var[2] = 200<br></code>
      </div></div>

      <h2>Array of pointers</h2>
		<p>Before we understand the concept of arrays of pointers, let us consider the following example, which makes use of an array of 3 integers:</p>
	
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br> <br>
        &emsp;const int MAX = 3;<br><br>
				&emsp;int main()<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int var[3] = {10, 100, 200};<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int i,*ptr[3];;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for (i = 0; i < MAX; i++)<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;ptr[i] = &var[i];<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for (i = 0; i < MAX; i++)<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; printf("Value of var[%d] = %d\n", i, *ptr[i] );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
				&emsp;}<br></code>
			</div>
		</div><br>
		<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
		<br>
		<div class="output">
		<code>Value of var[0] = 10
        &emsp;<br>Value of var[1] = 100
        &emsp;<br>Value of var[2] = 200<br></code>
      </div></div>
      <h2>Pointer to Pointer</h2>
		<p>A pointer to a pointer is a form of multiple indirection, or a chain of pointers. Normally, a pointer contains the address of a variable. When we define a pointer to a pointer, the first pointer contains the address of the second pointer, which points to the location that contains the actual value as shown below.</p><br>
		<img src="images/ptp.png"/>
		<p><br>A variable that is a pointer to a pointer must be declared as such. This is done by placing an additional asterisk in front of its name. For example, following is the declaration to declare a pointer to a pointer of type int:</p><br>
		<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;int **var;<br></code></div><br>
				<p>When a target value is indirectly pointed to by a pointer to a pointer, accessing that value requires that the asterisk operator be applied twice, as is shown below in the example:</p><br>

	
			<div> <br>
				<div class="code1">
				<code> &emsp;#include <<x>stdio.h> 
        <br> <br>
				&emsp;int main()<br>
				&emsp;{<br>
				
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int var;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int *ptr;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int **pptr;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;var = 3000;<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* take the address of var */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int ptr = &<<x>>var;;<br><br>
					&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* take the address of ptr using address of operator & */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;pptr = &<<x>>ptr;<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;/* take the value using pptr */<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Value of var = %d\n", var );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Value available at *ptr = %d\n", *ptr );<br>
				&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf("Value available at **pptr = %d\n", **pptr);<br><br>
				&emsp;&emsp;return 0;<br>
				&emsp;}<br></code>
			</div>
		</div><br>
		<p>When the above code is compiled and executed, it produces the following result:</p>
		<br>
		<div class="output">
		<code>Value of var = 3000
        &emsp;<br>Value available at *ptr = 3000
        &emsp;<br>Value available at **pptr = 3000<br></code>
      </div><br></div>
      <h2>Disadvantages of Pointers:</h2>
      <div><ul>
       <li>Pointers are a bit difficult to understand.</li>
       <li>Pointers can cause several errors, such as segmentation errors or unrequired memory access.</li>
       <li>If a pointer has an incorrect value, it may corrupt the memory.</li>
       <li>Pointers may also cause memory leakage.</li>
       <li>The pointers are relatively slower than the variables.</li>
</ul><br><br>
