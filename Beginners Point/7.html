		   </header>
				   <p>The variables used so far have all had a common characteristic:
	   each variable can only be used to store a single value at a
	   time. For example, each of the variables ch, n, and price
	   declared in the statements
	   <pre>char ch;
	   int n;
	   float price;</pre>
	   are of different data types and each variable can only store
	   one value of the declared data type. These types of variables
	   are called scalar variables. A scalar variable is a single
	   
	   variable whose stored value is an atomic type. This means
	   that the value cannot be further subdivided or separated into
	   a legitimate data type.
	   In contrast to atomic types, such as integer, floating
	   point, and double precision data, there are aggregate types.
	   An aggregate type, which is referred to as both a structured
	   type and a data structure, is any type whose values can be
	   decomposed and are related by some defined structure.
	   Additionally, operations must be available for retrieving
	   and updating individual values in the data structure. Such a
	   derived data type is an array.</p>
	   
	   
	   <h2> 7.2 One-Dimensional Array</h2>
	   <p>There are several forms of an array used in C: one-dimensional
	   or single-dimensional and multidimensional array. In this
	   section, one-dimensional arrays will be discussed.
	   Since the array is one dimensional, there will be a single
	   subscript or index whose value refers to the individual array
	   element which ranges from 0 to (n–1), where n is the total
	   number of elements in the array.</p>
	   
	   <h3> 7.2.1 Declaration of a One-dimensional Array </h3>
	   <p>To use an array variable in a program, it must be declared.
	   When defining an array in a program, three things need to be
	   specified.
	   <ol><li> The type of data it can hold, i.e., int, char, double, float, etc.</li>
	   <li> The number of values it can hold, i.e., the maximum
	   number of elements it can hold</li>
	   <li> A name</li></p>
	   <p>A one-dimensional array declaration is a data type followed
	   by an identifier with a bracketed constant integral expression.
	   The value of the expression, which must be positive, is the
	   size of the array. It specifies the number of elements in the
	   array. The array subscripts can range from 0 to (size –1). The
	   lower bound of the array subscripts is 0 and the upper bound
	   is (size –1). Thus, the following relationships hold.
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code> int a[size]; /* memory space for a[0],a[1],..., a[size –1]
	   
	   allocated */<br>
	   lower bound = 0<br>
	   upper bound = size –1<br>
	   size = upper bound + 1</code></div></p></br></b>
	   The syntax for declaration of a one-dimensional array is
	   data_type array_name [SIZE];
	   <ol><li> All the array elements hold values of type <data type>.</li>
	   <li> The size of the array is indicated by <SIZE>, the number of
	   elements in the array. <SIZE> must be an int constant or a
	   constant expression.</li>
	   For example, to declare an array that can hold up to 10
	   integers, the following statement has to be written.
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>int ar[10];</code></div></p></br></b>
	   This reserves space for 10 integers. Similarly,
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>int a[100]; /* an array with 100 int elements */</code></div></p></br></b>
	   declares an array ‘a’ that can hold 100 integers. Once declared,
	   an array element can be referenced as
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>[array name][index]</code></div></p></br></b>
	   where [index] is an integer constant or variable ranging
	   from 0 to [SIZE] – 1.
	   In the above example, the array index starts at 0, so for this
	   array there are elements named a[0], a[1], ..., a[99]. The
	   idea is that if there is an array variable named a, its elements
	   can be accessed with a[0], a[1], ..., a[99]. This means
	   that a particular element of the array can be accessed by its
	   ‘index’, a number that specifies which element is needed.</p>
	   
	   
	   
	   <h3>7.2.2 Initializing Integer Arrays</h3>
	   <p>Variables can be assigned values during declaration like the
	   following example.
	   <pre>int x = 7;</pre>
	   Arrays can be initialized in the same manner. However, since
	   an array has multiple elements, braces are used to denote
	   the entire array of values and commas are used to separate
	   the individual values assigned to the elements in the array
	   initialization statements</p>
	   
	   
	   
	   <h3>7.2.3 Accessing Array Elements</h3>
	   <p>Single operations, which involve entire arrays, are not
	   permitted in C. Thus, if x and y are similar arrays (i.e., of the
	   same data type, dimensionality, and size), then assignment
	   operations, comparison operations, etc., involving these two
	   arrays must be carried out on an element-by-element basis.
	   This is usually accomplished within a loop, or within nested
	   loops for multidimensional arrays.
	   For initializing an individual array element, a particular
	   array index has to be used. For example, in an array A, for
	   initializing elements 0 and 3, the following statements are
	   used,</p>
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>A[0] = 3;
	   A[3] = 7;</div></br></p></b></code>
	   <p>Subscripted variables can be used at any place where
	   scalar variables are valid. Examples using the elements of an
	   array named ‘numbers’ are shown here:
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>numbers [0] = 98;<br>
	   numbers [1] = numbers [0] – 11<br>
	   numbers [2] = 2 * (numbers [0] – 6);<br>
	   numbers [3] = 79;<br>
	   numbers [4] = (numbers [2] + numbers [3] – 3)/2;<br>
	   total = numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2] +
	   numbers[3] + numbers[4];</div></br></b></p></code>
	   <p>One extremely important advantage of using integer
	   expressions as subscripts is that it allows sequencing through
	   an array using a for loop. This makes statements such as
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>total = numbers[0] + numbers[1] + numbers[2] +
	   numbers[3] + numbers [4];</div></code></br></b></p>
	   
	   unnecessary. The subscript value in each of the subscripted
	   variables in this statement can be replaced by the counter in a
	   for loop to access each element in the array sequentially.
	   For example, the C statements,
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>total = 0; /*initialize total to zero */<br>
	   for(i = 0; i <5; ++i)<br>
	   total = total + numbers[i]; /* add in a number */</div></br></code></p></b>
	   <p>sequentially retrieve each array element and adds the element
	   to the total. Here the variable ‘i’ is used both as the counter in
	   the for loop and as a subscript. As ‘i’ increases by one each
	   time through the for loop, the next element in the array is
	   
	   referenced. The procedure for adding the array elements within
	   the for loop is the same as that used before.
	   The following code
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>/* Initialization of all of the elements of the sample
	   array to 0 */<br>
	   for(i = 0; i < 5; i++)<br>
	   {<br>
	   a[i] = 0;<br>
	   }</div></code></br></b></p>
	   would cause all the elements of the array to be set to 0.
	   Consider the following program that would use the above
	   code segment.
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>#include <stdio.h><br>
	   						#define ARRAY_SIZE 10<br>
	   						&emsp;int main()<br>
	   						&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;int index, a[ARRAY_SIZE];<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;for(index = 0; index < ARRAY_SIZE; index++)<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;{<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;a[index] = 0;<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;printf(“a[%d] = %d\n”, index, a[index]);<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
							&emsp;&emsp;printf(“\n”);<br>
							&emsp;return 0;<br>
	   						}<br></div></code></br></b></p>
	   <div class="output"> <b> <code>
		The output from the above example is as follows: <br>
		&emsp;a[1] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[0] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[2] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[3] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[4] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[5] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[6] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[7] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[8] = 0<br>
		&emsp;a[9] = 0 </code></b>
	   </div>
	   <!-- </div></code></br></b></p> -->
	   Arrays are a real convenience for many problems, but
	   there is not a lot that C can do with them automatically. In
	   particular, neither can all elements of an array be set at once
	   nor can one array be assigned to another. Both assignments
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>a = 0; /* WRONG */<br>
	   and<br>
	   int b[10];<br>
	   b = a; /* WRONG */</code></div></br></b></p>
	   are illegal, where a is an array.
	   So, for example, to assign values to (i.e., store values into)
	   an array, ar[10], the following program statements may be
	   used.
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>ar[0] = 1;<br>
	   ar[1] = 3;<br>
	   ar[2] = 5;<br>
	   ...<br>
	   ar[9] = 19;<br>
	   Or<br>
	   for(i = 0; i < 10; i++)<br>
	   ar[i] = (i*2) + 1;</div></code></br></b></p>
	   Notice how the variable i, used as a subscript, increments
	   from 0 to ‘less than’ 10, i.e., from 0 to 9. To access values in
	   an array, the same subscripted notation has to be utilized as
	   shown.
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>printf(“%d”, ar[2]);<br>
	   thirdOdd = ar[2];<br>
	   nthOddSquared = ar[n-1] * ar[n-1];</div></p></code></br></b>
	   
	   
	   
	   <h3>7.2.4 Internal Representation of Arrays in C</h3>
	   <p>Understanding how arrays work in C requires some
	   understanding of how they are represented in the computer’s
	   memory. In C, an array is implemented as a single block
	   of memory, with element 0 occupying the first ‘slot’ in
	   that block, that is, arrays are allocated contiguous space in
	   memory. As a result, C subscripts are closely related to actual
	   memory addresses and to the notion of ‘pointer’ 
	   The possible consequences of the misuse of arrays should
	   motivate one to pay close attention to the array indices.
	   For a simple variable (e.g., int, double, etc.) of data type
	   X, the compiler allocates <tt>sizeof(X)</tt> bytes to hold it. For an
	   array of length L and data type X, the compiler allocates <tt>L*
	   sizeof (X) bytes.</tt>
	   Given an array like <tt>int scores[100]</tt>, the compiler allocates
	   200 bytes starting at some location, say 64789. Given an
	   expression like <tt>scores[5]</tt>, the compiler accesses the value
	   stored at the memory location 64789+(5*2). In general, a[i]
	   is located at byte: base address of <tt>a + i * sizeof</tt> (type of
	   array).</p>
	   
	   
	   <h2>Searching an element within an array</h2>
	   <p>Consider an array of n elements, where each element is a key
	   (e.g., a number). The task is to find a particular key in the
	   array. The simplest method is a sequential search or linear
	   search. The idea is to simply search the array, element by
	   element, from the beginning until the key is found or the end
	   of the list is reached. If found, the corresponding position
	   in the array is printed; otherwise, a message will have to be
	   displayed that the key is not found. Now, the implementation
	   of the program will be
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>#include <stdio.h><br>
	   #include <stdlib.h><br>
	   int main()<br>
	   {<br>
	   int a[30],n,i,key, FOUND=0;<br>
	   printf(“\n How many numbers”);<br>
	   scanf(“%d”,&n);<br>
	   if(n>30)<br>
	   {<br>
	   printf(“\n Too many Numbers”);<br>
	   exit(0);<br>
	   }<br>
	   printf(“\n Enter the array elements \n”);<br>
	   for(i=0 ; i<n; i++)<br>
	   scanf(“%d”, &a[i]);<br>
	   printf(“\n Enter the key to be searched \n”);<br>
	   scanf(“%d”,&key);<br>
	   for(i=0 ; i<n; i++)<br>
	   if(a[i] == key)<br>
	   {<br>
	   printf(“\n Found at %d”,i);<br>
	   FOUND=1;<br>
	   }<br>
	   if(FOUND = = 0)<br>
	   printf(“\n NOT FOUND...”);<br>
	   return 0;<br>
	   }</code></div></br></p></b>
	   
	   
	   
	   <h2>Sorting an array</h2>
	   <h3>Bubble sort</h3><p> A bubble sort compares adjacent array ele-
	   ments and exchanges their values if they are out of order.
	   In this way, the smaller values ‘bubble’ to the top of the
	   array (towards element 0), while the larger values sink to the
	   bottom of the array. This sort continues until no exchanges
	   are performed in a pass. If no exchanges are made, then all
	   pairs must be in order. For this reason, a flag named ‘sorted’
	   is used. The way bubble sort works is that it iterates through the
	   data set comparing two neighbouring items at a time and
	   swapping them if the first item is larger than the second
	   item.
	   
	   
	   
	   <h2>Binary searching</h2>
	   <p>The drawbacks of sequential search can be eliminated if
	   it becomes possible to eliminate large portions of the list
	   from consideration in subsequent iterations. The binary
	   search method does just that; it halves the size of the list
	   to search in each iteration.
	   Binary search can be explained simply by the analogy of
	   searching for a page in a book. Suppose a reader is searching
	   for page 90 in a book of 150 pages. The reader would first
	   open the book at random towards the latter half of the book.
	   If the page number is less than 90, the reader would open at
	   a page to the right; if it is greater than 90, the reader would
	   open at a page to the left, repeating the process till page 90
	   was found. As can be seen, by the first instinctive search,
	   the reader dramatically reduced the number of pages to be
	   searched.
	   Binary search requires sorted data to operate on, since the
	   data may not be contiguous like the pages of a book. It is not
	   possible to guess in which quarter of the data set the required
	   item may be. So, the array is divided in the centre each time.
	   Binary search will first be illustrated with an example
	   before going on to formulate the algorithm and analysing it.
	   In binary search, implement the following procedure.
	   <ol><li> Look at the middle element of the list.</li>
	   <li> If it is the value being searched, then the job is done.</li>
	   <li> If the value that is being searched is smaller than the middle
	   element, then continue with the bottom half of the list.</li>
	   <li> If the value that is being searched is larger than the middle
	   element, then continue with the top half of the list.</li></ol>
	   
	   In effect, binary search splits the array in half and then
	   repeats the algorithm on the half that must contain the value
	   that it is searching for, if it is there at all.</p>
	   
	   <h3>Example ::</h3>
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>Consider the array<br>

	   <h3>Note ::</h3>
	   <p>Single operations, which involve entire arrays, are not
	   permitted in C.
	   <ol><li> Neither can all elements of an array be set at once nor
	   can one array be assigned to another.</li>
	   <li> For an array of length L and data type X, the compiler
	   allocates L* sizeof (X) bytes of contiguous space in
	   memory.</li>
	   <li> It is not possible to declare an array using a variable for the
	   size.</li></ol>
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   <h2> 7.3 Multidimensional Arrays</h2>
	   <p>Arrays with more than one dimension are called
	   multidimensional arrays. Although humans cannot easily
	   visualize objects with more than three dimensions,
	   representing multidimensional arrays presents no problem to
	   computers.</p>
	   
	   
	   <h3>7.3.1 Declaration of a Two-dimensional Array</h3>
	   An array of two dimensions can be declared as follows:
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>data_type array_name[size1][size2];</code></div></br></b></p>
	   Here, data_type is the name of some type of data, such as
	   int. Also, size1 and size2 are the sizes of the array’s first
	   and second dimensions, respectively.
	   Here is an example of defining an eight-by-eight array of
	   integers, similar to a chessboard. Remember, because C arrays
	   are zero-based, the indices on each side of the chessboard
	   array run from zero through seven, rather than one through
	   eight. The effect is the same. However, it is a two-dimensional
	   array of 64 elements which has the following declaration
	   statement.
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>int arr[8][8];</code></div></br></b></p>
					
	   
	   
	   
	   <h3>7.3.2 Declaration of a Three-dimensional Array</h3>
	   <p>A three-dimensional array, such as a cube, can be declared
	   as follows:
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>data_type array_name[size1][size2][size3]</code></div></br></p></b>
	   Arrays do not have to be shaped like squares and cubes;
	   each dimension of the array can be given a different size, as
	   follows:
	   <p><div> <br><b>
					   <div class="code1">
					   <code>int non_cube[2][6][8];</code></div></br></p></b>
	   Three-dimensional arrays, and higher, are stored in the same
	   basic way as are two-dimensional ones. They are kept in
	   computer memory as a linear sequence of variables, and the
	   last index is always the one that varies the fastest (then the
	   next-to-last, and so on).</p>
	   
	   
	   
	   <h2>Note ::</h2>
	   <ol><li> Multidimensional arrays are kept in computer memory as
	   a linear sequence of variables.</li>
	   <li> The elements of a multidimensional array are stored
	   contiguously in a block of computer memory.</li>
	   <li> The number of subscripts determines the dimensionality
	   of an array.</li>
	   <li> The separation of initial values into rows in the declaration
	   statement is not necessary.</li>
	   <li> If unsized arrays are declared, the C compiler automatically
	   creates an array big enough to hold all the initializers.</li></ol>
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   
	   <h2>Why do array subscripts start at 0 instead of 1?</h2>
	   <p>It can make array subscripting somewhat faster. Two facts are known
	   about an array. First, an array name say arr always designates the
	   base address of the array. Second, address of ith element of arr is given
	   by &arr[i], which is eventually (arr + i). The base address is the
	   address of the first element which is the address of the first element
	   &a[0]. This means that both arr and &a[0] hold the same value which
	   is the address of the first element of the array. To carry the expression
	   (arr+i), same equivalence for all the elements of the array, the subscript
	   of the first element must be 0. Having the subscript to start at 0 simplifies
	   scaling a bit for the compiler.</p>
