            <h2>14.1 Types and Declarations</h2>
            <p>We have not talked about the <tt>void</tt>,
                <tt>short int</tt>, and <tt>long double</tt> types.
                <tt>void</tt> is a type with no values,
                used as a placeholder to indicate functions that do not return values
                or that accept no arguments, and in the ``generic'' pointer type <tt>void *</tt> that can point to anything.
                <tt>short int</tt> is an integer type
                that might use less space than a plain <tt>int</tt>;
                <tt>long double</tt> is a floating-point type
                that might have even more range or precision than plain <tt>double</tt>.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The <tt>char</tt> type and the various sizes of <tt>int</tt>
                also have ``unsigned'' versions,
                which are declared using the keyword <tt>unsigned</tt>.
                Unsigned types
                cannot hold negative values but have guaranteed properties on overflow.
                (Whether a plain <tt>char</tt> is signed or unsigned is
                implementation-defined;
                you can use the keyword <tt>signed</tt>
                to force a character type to contain signed characters.)
                Unsigned types are also useful when manipulating individual bits and bytes,
                when ``sign extension'' might otherwise be a problem.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Two additional <dfn>type qualifiers</dfn>
                <tt>const</tt> and <tt>volatile</tt> allow you to declare variables
                (or pointers to data)
                which you promise not to change,
                or which might change in unexpected ways behind the program's back. <br>

            </p> <br>
            <p>There are user-defined <dfn>structure</dfn> and <dfn>union</dfn> types.
                A structure or <tt>struct</tt> is a ``record''
                consisting of one or more values of one or more types
                concreted together into one entity
                which can be manipulated as a whole.
                A <tt>union</tt> is a type which,
                at any one time,
                can hold a value
                from one of a
                specified
                set of types.
            </p> <br>
            <p>There are user-defined <dfn>enumeration</dfn> types
                (``<tt>enum</tt>'')
                which are like integers but
                which always contain values from some fixed, predefined set,
                and for which the values
                are referred to by name instead of by number.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Pointers can point to functions as well as to data types.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Types can be arbitrarily complicated,
                when you start using multiple levels of pointers, arrays,
                functions, structures, and/or unions.
                Eventually,
                it's important to understand the concept of a <dfn>declarator</dfn>:
                in the declaration
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    int i, *ip, *fpi();<br>
            </code><br>
             </div>
            we have the <dfn>base type</dfn> <tt>int</tt>
            and three declarators <tt>i</tt>, <tt>*ip</tt>, and <tt>*fpi()</tt>.
            The declarator gives the name of a variable (or function) and also indicates whether it is a simple variable
            or a pointer, array, function, or some more elaborate combination (array of pointers, function returning pointer, etc.).
            In the example, <tt>i</tt> is declared to be a plain <tt>int</tt>, <tt>ip</tt> is declared to be a pointer to <tt>int</tt>,
            and <tt>fpi</tt> is declared to be a function returning pointer to <tt>int</tt>.
            (Complicated declarators may also contain parentheses for grouping, since there's a precedence hierarchy in declarators as well as expressions: <tt>[]</tt> for arrays and <tt>()</tt> for functions have higher precedence than <tt>*</tt> for pointers.)
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>We have not said much about pointers to pointers, or arrays of arrays (i.e. multidimensional arrays),
                or the ramifications of array/pointer equivalence on multidimensional arrays. (In particular, a reference to an array of arrays
                does <em>not</em> generate a pointer to a pointer; it generates a pointer to an array. You cannot pass a multidimensional array
                to a function which accepts pointers to pointers.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>Variables can be declared with a hint that they be placed in high-speed CPU registers,
                for efficiency. (These hints are rarely needed or used today,
                because modern compilers do a good job of register allocation by themselves, without hints.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>A mechanism called <tt>typedef</tt> allows you to define
                user-defined aliases (i.e. new and perhaps more-convenient names)
                for other types.
            </p> 
            
            <h2>14.2 Operators</h2>
            <p>The <dfn>bitwise operators</dfn>
                <tt>&amp;</tt>, <tt>|</tt>, <tt>^</tt>, and <tt>~</tt>
                operate on integers thought of as binary numbers or strings of bits.
                The <tt>&amp;</tt> operator is bitwise AND,
                the <tt>|</tt> operator is bitwise OR,
                the <tt>^</tt> operator is bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR),
                and the <tt>~</tt> operator is a bitwise negation or complement.
                (<tt>&amp;</tt>, <tt>|</tt>, and <tt>^</tt> are ``binary''
                in that they take two operands;
                <tt>~</tt> is unary.) <br>
                These operators let you work with the individual bits of a variable;
                one common use is to treat an integer as a set of single-bit
                <dfn>flags</dfn>.
                You might define the 3rd (2**2) bit as the ``verbose'' flag bit by defining </p> <br>
                <div class="code">
                    <code>  
                        #define VERBOSE 4<br>
                </code><br>
                 </div>
            Then you can ``turn the verbose bit on'' in an integer variable <tt>flags</tt> by executing
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    flags = flags | VERBOSE; <br>
                    or <br>
                    flags |= VERBOSE;<br>
            </code><br>
             </div>
            and turn it off with
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    flags = flags &amp; ~VERBOSE; <br>
                    or <br>
                    flags &amp;= ~VERBOSE; <br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            and test whether it's set with
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    if(flags &amp; VERBOSE)<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>The left-shift and right-shift operators
                <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;&gt;</tt>
                let you shift an integer left or right by some number of bit positions;
                for example,
                <tt>value &lt;&lt; 2</tt>
                shifts <tt>value</tt> left by two bits.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The <tt>?:</tt> or <dfn>conditional</dfn> operator
                (also called the ``ternary operator'')
                essentially lets you embed an <tt>if</tt>/<tt>then</tt> statement
                in an expression.
                The assignment
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    a = expr ? b : c;<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            is roughly equivalent to
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    if(expr) <br>
                        a = b; <br>
                    else	a = c;<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            Since you can use <tt>?:</tt> anywhere in an expression,
            it can do things that <tt>if</tt>/<tt>then</tt> can't,
            or that would be cumbersome with <tt>if</tt>/<tt>then</tt>.
            For example, the function call
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    f(a, b, c ? d : e);<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            is roughly equivalent to
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    if(c) <br>
                        f(a, b, d); <br>
                    else	f(a, b, e);<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            (Exercise: what would the call
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    g(a, b, c ? d : e, h ? i : j, k);<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            be equivalent to?)
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>The comma operator lets you put two separate expressions where
                one is required;
                the expressions are executed one after the other.
                The most common use for comma operators is when you want
                multiple variables controlling a <tt>for</tt> loop,
                for example:
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    for(i = 0, j = 10; i &lt; j; i++, j--)<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>A <dfn>cast operator</dfn> allows you to explicitly force
                conversion of a value from one type to another.
                A cast consists of a type name in parentheses.
                For example, you could convert an <tt>int</tt> to a <tt>double</tt>
                by typing
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    int i = 10; <br>
                    double d; <br>
                    d = (double)i;<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            (In this case, though, the cast is redundant, since this is a
            conversion that C would have performed for you automatically,
            i.e. if you'd just said <tt>d = i</tt>
            .)
            You use explicit casts in those circumstances
            where C does not do a needed conversion automatically.
            One example is division:
            if you're dividing two integers and you want a floating-point result,
            you must explicitly force at least one of the operands to floating-point,
            otherwise C will perform an integer division and will discard the remainder.
            The code
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    int i = 1, j = 2; <br>
                    double d = i / j;<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            will set <tt>d</tt> to 0,
            but
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    d = (double)i / j;<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            will set <tt>d</tt> to 0.5.
            You can also ``cast to <tt>void</tt>''
            to explicitly indicate that you're ignoring a function's return value,
            as in
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    (void)fclose(fp);<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            or
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    (void)printf("Hello, world!\n");<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            (Usually, it's a bad idea to ignore return values,
            but in some cases it's essentially inevitable,
            and the <tt>(void)</tt> cast keeps some compilers from
            issuing warnings every time you ignore a value.)
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>There's a precise,
                mildly elaborate
                set of rules which C uses for converting values automatically,
                in the absence of explicit casts.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The <tt>.</tt> and <tt>-&gt;</tt> operators
                let you access the members (components) of structures and unions.
            </p>
            
            <h2>14.3 Statements</h2>
            <p>The <tt>switch</tt> statement allows you to jump to one of a
                number of numeric <tt>case</tt> labels depending on the value of
                an expression;
                it's more convenient than a long <tt>if</tt>/<tt>else</tt> chain.
                (However, you can use <tt>switch</tt>
                only when the expression is integral
                and all of the <tt>case</tt> labels are compile-time constants.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>The <tt>do</tt>/<tt>while</tt> loop
                is a loop that tests its controlling expression
                at the bottom of the loop,
                so that the body of the loop always executes once
                even if the condition is initially false.
                (C's <tt>do</tt>/<tt>while</tt> loop is therefore like
                Pascal's <tt>repeat</tt>/<tt>until</tt> loop,
                while

                C's <tt>while</tt> loop is like Pascal's <tt>while</tt>/<tt>do</tt> loop.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>Finally,
                when you really need to write ``spaghetti code,''
                C does have the all-purpose <tt>goto</tt> statement,
                and labels to go to.
            </p>
            
            <h2>14.4 Functions</h2>
            <p>Functions can't return arrays,
                and it's tricky to write a function as if it returns an array
                (perhaps by simulating the array with a pointer)
                because you have to be careful about allocating the memory that
                the returned pointer points to.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The functions we've written have all accepted a well-defined,
                fixed number of arguments.
                <tt>printf</tt> accepts a variable number of arguments
                (depending on how many <tt>%</tt> signs there are
                in the format string)
                but we haven't seen how to declare and write functions that do this.
            </p> 
            
            <h2>14.5 C Preprocessor</h2>
            <p>If you're careful,
                it's possible
                (and
                can be
                useful)
                to use <tt>#include</tt> within a header file,
                so that you end up with ``nested header files.''
            </p> <br>
            <p>It's possible to use <tt>#define</tt>
                to define ``function-like'' macros
                that accept arguments;
                the expansion of the macro can therefore depend on the
                arguments it's ``invoked'' with.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Two special preprocessing operators <tt>#</tt> and <tt>##</tt>
                let you control the expansion of macro arguments
                in fancier ways.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The preprocessor directive <tt>#if</tt> lets you conditionally
                include (or, with <tt>#else</tt>, conditionally not include)
                a section of code depending on some arbitrary compile-time expression.
                (<tt>#if</tt> can also do the same macro-definedness tests
                as <tt>#ifdef</tt> and <tt>#ifndef</tt>,
                because the expression can
                use
                a <tt>defined()</tt> operator.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>Other preprocessing directives are
                <tt>#elif</tt>, <tt>#error</tt>,
                <tt>#line</tt>, and <tt>#pragma</tt>.
            </p> <br>
            <p>There are a few predefined preprocessor macros,
                some required by the C standard,
                others perhaps defined by
                particular compilation environments.
                These are useful for conditional compilation
                (<tt>#ifdef</tt>, <tt>#ifndef</tt>).

            <h2>14.6 Standard Library Functions</h2>
            <p>C's standard library contains many features and functions
                which we haven't seen.
            </p> <br>
            <p>We've seen many of <tt>printf</tt>'s formatting capabilities,
                but not all.
                Besides format specifier characters for a few types we haven't seen,

                you can also control the width, precision,
                justification (left or right) 
                and a few other attributes of <tt>printf</tt>'s format conversions. <br> <br>
                (In their full complexity,
                <tt>printf</tt> formats are about as elaborate and powerful
                as FORTRAN <tt>format</tt> statements.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>A <tt>scanf</tt> function lets you do ``formatted input''
                analogous to <tt>printf</tt>'s formatted output.
                <tt>scanf</tt> reads from the standard input;
                a variant <tt>fscanf</tt> reads from a specified file pointer.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The
                <tt>sprintf</tt> and <tt>sscanf</tt>
                functions
                let you
                ``print'' and ``read''
                to and from in-memory strings instead of files.
                We've seen that <tt>atoi</tt> lets you convert a numeric
                string into an integer;
                the inverse operation can be performed with <tt>sprintf</tt>:
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    int i = 10; <br>
                    char str[10]; <br>
                    sprintf(str, "%d", i);<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>We've used <tt>printf</tt> and <tt>fprintf</tt> to write formatted output,
                and <tt>getchar</tt>, <tt>getc</tt>, <tt>putchar</tt>, and <tt>putc</tt>
                to read and write characters. <br> <br>
                There are also functions
                <tt>gets</tt>, <tt>fgets</tt>, <tt>puts</tt>, and <tt>fputs</tt>
                for reading and writing lines
                (though we rarely need these,
                especially if we're using our own <tt>getline</tt>
                and maybe <tt>fgetline</tt>),
                and also <tt>fread</tt> and <tt>fwrite</tt>
                for reading or writing arbitrary numbers of characters.
            </p> <br>
            <p>It's possible to ``un-read'' a character,
                that is,
                to push it back on an input stream, with <tt>ungetc</tt>.
                (This is useful if you accidentally read one character too far,
                and would prefer that some other part of your program
                read that character instead.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>You can use the
                <tt>ftell</tt>, <tt>fseek</tt>, and <tt>rewind</tt> functions
                to jump around in files,
                performing random access (as opposed to sequential) I/O.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The <tt>feof</tt> and <tt>ferror</tt> functions will tell you
                whether you got <tt>EOF</tt> due to an actual end-of-file
                condition or due to a read error of some sort.
                You can clear errors and end-of-file conditions with
                <tt>clearerr</tt>.
            </p> <br>
            <p>You can open files in ``binary'' mode, or for
                simultaneous

                reading and writing.
                (These options involve extra characters
                appended to <tt>fopen</tt>'s mode string:
                <tt>b</tt> for binary,
                <tt>+</tt> for read/write.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>There are several more string functions in <tt>&lt;string.h&gt;</tt>.
                A second set of string functions
                <tt>strncpy</tt>, <tt>strncat</tt>, and <tt>strncmp</tt>
                all
                accept a third argument telling them to
                stop after <tt>n</tt> characters
                if they haven't found the <tt>\0</tt> marking the end of the string. <br> <br>
                A third set of ``<tt>mem</tt>'' functions,
                including <tt>memcpy</tt> and <tt>memcmp</tt>,
                operate on blocks of memory
                which aren't necessarily strings
                and where <tt>\0</tt> is not treated as a terminator.
                The <tt>strchr</tt> and <tt>strrchr</tt> functions
                find characters in strings.
                There is a motley collection
                of ``span'' and ``scan'' functions,
                <tt>strspn</tt>, <tt>strcspn</tt>, and <tt>strpbrk</tt>,
                for searching out or skipping over sequences of characters all
                drawn from a specified set of characters. <br>
                The <tt>strtok</tt> function aids in breaking up a string
                into words or ``tokens,''
                much like our own <tt>getwords</tt> function.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The header file <tt>&lt;ctype.h&gt;</tt> contains several functions
                which let you classify and manipulate characters:
                check for letters or digits,
                convert between upper- and lower-case,
                etc.
            </p> <br>
            <p>A host of mathematical functions
                are defined in the header file <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>.
                (As we've mentioned, besides including <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>,
                you may on some Unix systems
                have to ask for a special library containing the math functions
                while compiling/linking.)
            </p> <br>
            <p>There's a random-number generator, <tt>rand</tt>,
                and a way to ``seed'' it, <tt>srand</tt>.
                <tt>rand</tt> returns integers from 0 up to <tt>RAND_MAX</tt>
                (where <tt>RAND_MAX</tt> is a constant
                <tt>#define</tt>d in <tt>&lt;stdlib.h&gt;</tt>).
                One way of getting random integers from 1 to <tt>n</tt> is to call
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    (int)(rand() / (RAND_MAX + 1.0) * n) + 1<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            Another way is
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    rand() / (RAND_MAX / n + 1) + 1<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            It seems like it would be simpler to just say
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    rand() % n + 1<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            but this method is imperfect
            (or rather, it's imperfect if
            <tt>n</tt> is a power of two
            and
            your system's implementation of <tt>rand()</tt> is imperfect,
            as all too many of them are).
            <p></p> <br>
            <p>Several functions let you interact with
                the operating system under which your program is running.
                The <tt>exit</tt> function
                returns control to the operating system immediately,
                terminating your program
                and returning an ``exit status.'' <br><br>
                The <tt>getenv</tt> function allows you to read
                your operating system's
                or process's
                ``environment variables''
                (if any).
                The <tt>system</tt> function
                allows you to invoke an operating-system command
                (i.e. another program)
                from within your program.
            </p> <br>
            <p>The <tt>qsort</tt> function allows you to sort an array
                (of any type);
                you supply a comparison function
                (via a function pointer)
                which knows how to compare two array elements,
                and <tt>qsort</tt> does the rest.
                The <tt>bsearch</tt> function allows you to
                search for elements in sorted arrays;
                it, too, operates in terms of a caller-supplied comparison function.
            </p> <br>
            <p>Several functions--<tt>time</tt>,
                <tt>asctime</tt>,
                <tt>gmtime</tt>,
                <tt>localtime</tt>,
                <tt>asctime</tt>,
                <tt>mktime</tt>,
                <tt>difftime</tt>,
                and
                <tt>strftime</tt>--allow
                you to determine the current date and time,
                print dates and times,
                and perform other date/time manipulations.
                For example, to print today's date in a program,
                you can write
            </p> <br>
            <div class="code">
                <code>  
                    #include &lt;time.h&gt; <br>                
                    time_t now; <br>
                    now = time((time_t *)NULL); <br>
                    printf("It's %.24s", ctime(&amp;now));<br>
            </code><br>
            </div>
            <p>The header file <tt>&lt;stdarg.h&gt;</tt> lets you manipulate
                variable-length function argument lists
                (such as the ones <tt>printf</tt> is called with). <br> <br>
                Additional members of the <tt>printf</tt> family of functions
                let you write your own functions which accept
                <tt>printf</tt>-like format specifiers and
                variable numbers of arguments but call on the
                standard <tt>printf</tt> to do most of the work.
            </p> <br>
            <p>There are facilities for dealing with
                multibyte and ``wide'' characters and strings,
                for use with multinational character sets.
            </p> <br> <br>
